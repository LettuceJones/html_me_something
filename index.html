<h2>iPhone Repair</h2>

<p>iPhone will be the bulk of the phones you deal with if you get into the smartphone reapir business. As of now all iPhone parts can be replaced by a third party excluding the home button for the iPhone 7,7+,8,and 8+. When Apple introduced touch ID(fingerprint scanner) they made it so you loose the touch ID functionality when you replace the home button, but with the iphone 7 and above you loose ALL functionality if you replace the home button. Only Apple stores can replace a home button and keep touch ID functional</p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy S Phones</h2>

<p>Samsung Galaxy S phones will be the second most common smartphone brand you will see when doing repairs. Note that I'm specifically saying "Galaxy S" and not just "Samsung" because Samsung's other smartphones are not worth repairing (would cost more to repair than the price of the phone) and you mostly can't get the parts anyway. Many smartphone repair businesses don't bother with Android phones at all, personally I think that is dumb. Starting with the Galaxy S8, the Galaxy S phones are very profitable and actually very easy to repair as long as you have a good heat pad and an “iFlex” tool. Galaxy S phones older than the 8 are pretty much not worth repairing this day in age (but some people are still willing to pay for a new screen to get precious data off old phones).</p>
<h2>Tablets</h2>

<p>Tablet repair ranges from very easy to very hard. It can be very profitable sometimes, especially when you only have to replace the glass/digitizer. You will mostly see iPads but Android tablets can be worth repairing too.</p>
<h2>Other Smartphones</h2>

<p>The rest of the smartphones out there worth repairing are a mixed bag of difficulty, profitablity, and availablity of parts. It'll mostly be "LG G" phones, various Motorolla brands, and "Google Pixel" phones</p>
